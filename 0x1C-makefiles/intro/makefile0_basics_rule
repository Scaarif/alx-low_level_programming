# By default, only the first target 9say hello) is rum by make
# This' because only the first target in the makefile is the dafault target (default goal)
# As such, you'll see all included in most makefiles as the first target -> it is its responsibility
# to call all other targets
#
# We can override the dafault behaviour using a special phony target (a target that does not refer to a file,
# its essentially the name of a recipe) DEFAULT_GOAL
